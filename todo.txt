- disentangle the wind rotation from the "rotator" UI, which should be part of the client-ui instead.
- can players win on a self-drawn tile? What happens? Is there a way to detect self-drawn?
- try to reduce the number of places where sets can be either [int, ...] or [<span data-tile="int">, ...]
- score breakdowns?
