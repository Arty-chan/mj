- disentangle the wind rotation from the "rotator" UI, which should be part of the client-ui instead.
- replace this.el for bot players with a tile bank object. Human players get their HTML client, but bots really don't need one. At all.
- can players win on a self-drawn tile? What happens? Is there a way to detect self-drawn?
