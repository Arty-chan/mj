**Is this actually a bug report?**
If something isn't working, it's a bug. If something _is_ working, but you just don't like _how_ it works, then it's an improvement request. So if it's the latter, you're in the right place, but if it's the former: please go back pick bug report.

**What kind of thing would you like to see improved?**
- [ ] A part of the user interface
- [ ] A part of the user experience
