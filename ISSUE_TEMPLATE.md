Hi, and thank you for caring about the game enough to click the "new issue" button because you wanted to report a bug, or have some feedback!

If you have some feedback, then just start typing away and we can start a conversation (long or short, depending on what's necessary, of couse), but if you think you found a bug, there are some extra steps required, because in order to track down your bug I'll need to try to recreate the game as it was when you into the bug so:

Try to describe your bug in steps:

1. what was the game situation,  
2. what did you want to do,
3. what thing, or sequence of things, did you do in order to achieve that
4. what happened instead?

Of course, sometimes a bug can be because the computer did something unexpected:

1. what was the game situation
2. what happened that was perfectly normal
3. what then happened that was strange, or even wrong?
4. what would you have expected to have happen insead? (and "nothing special" is a perfectly valid expectation!)
  
If you have screenshots, those help a lot, and if you're a bit of a developer yourself, or you know what "the dev console" is and you've used it before, you might even consider playing with the `debug` flag turned on in the game settings, which will allow you to paste gameplay information in your bug reports.

Thank you for your interest in the game, and hopefully together we can make it even better!
